          <p>
            After you place your bet, the dealer gives you seven cards and deals
            seven downcards to himself. You have to create a two card hand and a
            five card hand out of the seven cards. The online casino lets you do
            this via the House Way tool, or you can do it on your own. Make sure
            that the two card hand is of less value than the five card hand.
            Here’s an example:
          </p>
          <p>
            Dealer gives you a Jack, Joker, 3, 9, 10, 8, Queen. You put the 3
            with the Joker for the two card hand and the Jack, 9, 10, Queen and
            8 for the five card hand. The reason that you do this is so that you
            can create a straight with the five card hand, 8, 9, 10, Jack and
            Queen.

                    After you place your bet, the dealer gives you seven cards
                    and deals seven downcards to himself. You have to create a
                    two card hand and a five card hand out of the seven cards.
                    The online casino lets you do this via the House Way tool,
                    or you can do it on your own. Make sure that the two card
                    hand is of less value than the five card hand. Here’s an
                    example:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dealer gives you a Jack, Joker, 3, 9, 10, 8, Queen. You put
                    the 3 with the Joker for the two card hand and the Jack, 9,
                    10, Queen and 8 for the five card hand. The reason that you
                    do this is so that you can create a straight with the five
                    card hand, 8, 9, 10, Jack and Queen.

                    card hand is Ace (Joker), 3. If the dealer’s five card hand
                    is King, King, King, 3, 2, then you win with your five card
                    hand because a straight beats 3 of a Kind. If the dealer’s
                    two card hand is Ace, 4, then you lose with your two card
                    hand because an Ace, 4 beats an Ace (Joker), 3.

                    After you place your bet, the dealer gives you seven cards
                    and deals seven downcards to himself. You have to create a
                    two card hand and a five card hand out of the seven cards.
                    The online casino lets you do this via the House Way tool,
                    or you can do it on your own. Make sure that the two card
                    hand is of less value than the five card hand. Here’s an
                    example:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dealer gives you a Jack, Joker, 3, 9, 10, 8, Queen. You put
                    the 3 with the Joker for the two card hand and the Jack, 9,
                    10, Queen and 8 for the five card hand. The reason that you
                    do this is so that you can create a straight with the five
                    card hand, 8, 9, 10, Jack and Queen.
                  </p>

                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    For your two card hand, the Joker counts as an Ace. Your two
                    card hand is Ace (Joker), 3. If the dealer’s five card hand
                    is King, King, King, 3, 2, then you win with your five card
                    hand because a straight beats 3 of a Kind. If the dealer’s
                    two card hand is Ace, 4, then you lose with your two card
                    hand because an Ace, 4 beats an Ace (Joker), 3.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The end result in this example is a tie. You won the five
                    card hand and the dealer won the two card hand.
